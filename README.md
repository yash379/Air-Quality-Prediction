# Air-Quality-Prediction

The "Air Quality Prediction" project focuses on predicting air quality levels using a dataset that includes various environmental parameters such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter concentrations (RSPM, SPM, PM2.5), and other relevant factors. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for different locations based on the provided parameters.
